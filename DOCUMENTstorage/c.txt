Tizen vs Android: What’s the difference?

Now we have the techy bit out of the way let’s take a look at our original question and discover the similarities and differences between Android and Tizen.

    Start-up - Tizen is lightweight and offers a faster start-up compared to Android.
    Smoother scrolling - Tizen offers improved scrolling and rendering performance for web browsing.
    Notification bar - Just like devices running Samsung’s TouchWiz UI there will be a swipe down notification bar on Tizen devices.
    3D - Tizen will offer 3D window effects with support for apps and games that require advanced 3D graphics.
    Multi-tasking and multi-touch - Multi-taking and multi-touch gestures are supported just like on Android devices.
    Dynamic boxes - Tizen’s dynamic box icons can be resized to show more or less information.
    64-bit processors - Tizen version 3 will support 64-bit processors, which is something that Google is working on for its next Android update.

An initial Samsung Mobile trial of the Tizen OS on a smartphone received comments that there was nothing different from Android and iOS. 

We could suggest that this was a negative piece of news but instead we should think of this as a positive step that confirms that the base model is running successfully and on a par with Android and iOS.
