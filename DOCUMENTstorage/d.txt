Many people think that all Androids are equal and it's a race to the bottom where the cheapest vendor wins. This could not be farther from the truth. For me, it all began half-a-year ago, when I bought the Samsung Galaxy S III and was absolutely stunned by it, then exploring and comparing it with other Androids. Now that Google has fired a shot across the bow with its low pricing for the unlocked Nexus 4, where does that leave Samsung and its flagship handset? For Samsung, it all began years ago when, like many Android hardware vendors, Samsung started to build custom icon sets & themes on top of Android, and over time it expanded into other areas. It turns out that Samsung took Google's Android code and applied a ton of patches on top, creating a new variant. Something I'll call the "Samsung Android" operating system.
